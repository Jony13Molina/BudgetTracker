(1) costOfAllCategories does not update when a custom category is added, and thus BarGraph and PieChart do not update.

(2) RecentPurchases seems to crash on some null pointer. 
    - null pointer seems to be on a missing item index on Firebase for a previously deleted item in a given week (i.e. if index 4 has
      been deleted, the index itself will be treated as null, crashing the app)
